Javascript Class
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp
A JavaScript class is not an object.
It is a template for JavaScript objects.

The Constructor Method
The constructor method is a special method:

It has to have the exact name "constructor"
It is executed automatically when a new object is created
It is used to initialize object properties
If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.

class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
  age() {
    let date = new Date();
    return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
  }
}

let myCar = new Car("Ford", 2014);
console.log(myCar.age(year))
